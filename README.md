# **TagStream**

TagStream Continues Deployment

## TagStream Overview

TagStream is an automated deployment pipeline designed to streamline the process of building, tagging, and deploying containerized applications based on GitHub release tags. It ensures that every new release is seamlessly integrated and deployed, reducing manual intervention and enhancing deployment efficiency.

## Key Features

Automated Triggering:
Release-Based Deployment: Automatically triggers the deployment process whenever a new release tag is created in the GitHub repository.

Continuous Integration: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to ensure that the latest code changes are always deployed.


## Containerization:

Docker Integration: Utilizes Docker to build and manage container images.

Multi-Platform Support: Supports building images for multiple platforms (e.g., x86, ARM).

## Deployment Flexibility:

Kubernetes Integration: Easily deploys containers to Kubernetes clusters.

Cloud Compatibility: Compatible with major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud for seamless deployment.

## Security and Compliance:

Secret Management: Securely manages credentials and secrets required for deployment.

Compliance Checks: Ensures that deployments meet organizational compliance and security standards.

## Monitoring and Logging:

Real-Time Monitoring: Provides real-time monitoring of deployment status and container health.

Detailed Logging: Offers detailed logs for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.

## Workflow Example

Hereâ€™s a simplified workflow of how TagStream operates:

Code Commit: Developers push code changes to the GitHub repository.

Release Creation: A new release is created with a specific tag (e.g., v1.0.0).

Trigger Workflow: The creation of the release tag triggers the TagStream workflow.

Build Container: The workflow builds a Docker container image based on the latest code.

Push to Registry: The built image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

Deploy Container: The container is deployed to the specified environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster).

Monitor Deployment: The deployment is monitored for any issues, and logs are generated for review.

## Benefits

Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors.

Consistency: Ensures consistent deployment processes across different environments.

Scalability: Easily scales with the growth of your application and infrastructure.
Reliability: Provides a reliable and repeatable deployment process.
